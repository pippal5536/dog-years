## Introduction
This project is a simple JavaScript program that converts human age to dog years. The conversion takes into account that the first two years of a dog's life count as 10.5 dog years each, and each subsequent year counts as 4 dog years.

## Project Problem
Dogs age differently than humans, and this project aims to provide an easy way to convert human age to the equivalent dog age. This helps to understand the aging process of dogs compared to humans.

## Solution Overview
The solution involves a JavaScript program that:
1. Declares a variable for the human age.
2. Calculates the dog years for the first two years.
3. Calculates the dog years for the remaining years.
4. Adds both values to get the total dog years.
5. Outputs the result in a formatted string.

## Challenges Faced
Some challenges faced during the project included understanding the use of the multiplication assignment operator and ensuring the correct sequence of operations to accurately convert human years to dog years.

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I learned:
- How to use JavaScript variables and mathematical operators.
- The importance of order of operations in calculations.
- How to use string methods like `.toLowerCase()`.
- How to use template literals for string interpolation in JavaScript.

## Project Sources and Inspiration
This project was inspired by Codecademy's Learn JavaScript course, which provides practical exercises to understand JavaScript fundamentals.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript: The programming language used for the conversion logic.
- Codecademy: The platform where the project was developed and learned.

## Installation and Usage
To run this project:
1. Ensure you have a JavaScript runtime environment (like Node.js) or a web browser console.
2. Copy the provided JavaScript code into your runtime environment or a `.js` file.
3. Run the code to see the conversion output.

Example with Node.js:
```bash
node dogYearsConverter.js
```
